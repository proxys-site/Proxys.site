      {
        "question": "What is a proxy server?",
        "answer": "A proxy server acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between residential and datacenter proxies?",
        "answer": "Residential proxies are IP addresses provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to homeowners. Datacenter proxies are not affiliated with ISPs; they are created in data centers and are not associated with a physical address."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are proxies legal to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, using proxies is legal. However, how you use them determines their legality. Using proxies for illegal activities is, of course, against the law."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I choose the right proxy for my needs?",
        "answer": "The right proxy depends on your use case. For web scraping, residential or datacenter proxies are common. For anonymity, look into anonymous proxies. For gaming, low-latency gaming proxies are best. Our guides can help you choose."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are free proxies safe to use?",
        "answer": "Free proxies can be risky. They may be slow, unreliable, and could potentially monitor your data or inject ads. For sensitive tasks, it's highly recommended to use a paid, reputable proxy provider."
