      {
        "question": "What is a proxy detector tool?",
        "answer": "A proxy detector tool is an online service that analyzes IP addresses to determine if they are using proxy servers, VPNs, or Tor networks. It helps identify masked connections and provides detailed information about the IP's origin, location, and connection type."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is the proxy detection?",
        "answer": "Our proxy detector uses advanced IP intelligence databases and real-time analysis to provide highly accurate results. The detection accuracy is typically above 95% for identifying VPNs, proxies, and Tor connections. However, some sophisticated proxy services may occasionally evade detection."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I check any IP address?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can check any public IP address (both IPv4 and IPv6) using our tool. Simply enter the IP address in the input field and click \"Check IP\" to get detailed analysis including proxy detection, location information, and risk assessment."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is my data stored or logged?",
        "answer": "No, we prioritize your privacy. We do not store, log, or track any IP addresses that you check using our tool. All queries are processed in real-time and no personal data is retained on our servers."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the risk score?",
        "answer": "The risk score is a numerical value (0-100) that indicates the likelihood of suspicious or fraudulent activity associated with an IP address. A score of 0 means clean connection, while higher scores indicate potential risks such as VPN usage, proxy servers, or datacenter IPs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why would I need to detect proxies?",
        "answer": "Proxy detection is useful for various purposes: preventing fraud, enforcing geographic restrictions, identifying bot traffic, verifying user authenticity, protecting against account abuse, and ensuring compliance with regional content licensing agreements."
